TPS Activity 2
1. I can navigate to my applications folder, look for an application called
Terminal, and then click on that to open the terminal for mac.
1a. I can open more than 1 terminal at the same time 
1b. Maybe I would want to be able to run multiple programs at the same time. Also I 
could possibly want to be able to run a different Linux command while another is running.

2. To tell what contents are inside the current directory, I would type ls.

3. To navigate to my Desktop directory, I would type cd ../../, and keep adding ../
while pressing tab at the same time until Desktop shows up as an option.

1. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24819206/using-gcc-to-compile-c-code
   https://www.wikihow.com/Compile-a-C-Program-Using-the-GNU-Compiler-(GCC)

2. Done 
3. gcc -o executableName nameofYourFile.c
4. You know if your code has compiled correctly if an executable file with 
the specificed name in your gcc command shows up in your directory, and you 
are able to run it correctly with ./executableName. 
5. The -c flag compiles the code without creating an executable file 
6. The -g flag creates debugging information for your specificed file. 
7. You do mv main cselab1
8. It creates an executable called a.out. 
9. It runs the program as expected, printing "Welcome to CSE031!" to the terminal.
