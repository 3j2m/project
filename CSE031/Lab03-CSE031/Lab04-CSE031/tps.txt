TPS Activity 1
1. I predict that it will simply print 2, which is what 2 is in hexadecimal. 
2. Since the second for loop assigns the char A to four_ints[0], I predict
that it will print the ASCI value for A. 
3. My prediction was slightly correct. It printed all 4 ASCI values 
for A, B, C, and D. 
4. I am really lost by the results. Why does it print 2?
5a) I am sure that only 2 arrays were allocated in the program. 
b) Yes, they point to the same location
c) Ok. Also I was right they do point to the same location 

6) the difference between consecutive elements is a difference 
in memory of a single byte. I guess that means each element of the 
array points to a unique byte in memory.

1. Line 8 essentially dynamically allocates an array of pointers (a 2d array)
2. Shown in the code
3. Shown in the code 
4. You need to pass the size of the argument so the for loop
knows when to stop printing values of the array.
5. Shown in the code
6. Shown in the code
7. Shown in the code
