Assignment 1
1. lldb is returning 3 possible reasons for the segmentation fault. Scanf input somewhere
line 22 or line 30.
2. The first line error appears at line 22, so I would assume the fault occurs there.
I will fix that by adding the dereferencing operator & to the scanf. 

3. After inspection with lldb, the value of the "values" variable 
is being updated correctly. However, the code does the computation 
of sum divided by values, where sum is initialized as 0, and never updated. 
4. The fix would be to, instead of passing the actual variable of the function
as an argument, I would pass the address of the sum to the function (&values),
so that it is correctly updated. Also updating the body of read_values so that 
it correctly updates sum 

Assignment 2 
1. The output is as expected
2. THe bug is that it appends the value of string 2 on the first run to the correct 
append on the second run.
3. The output is not as expected. It might be because the program does not know how to 
handle spaces correctly
